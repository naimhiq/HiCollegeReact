## CHALLENGE2

Now that you have learnt about components, state, props, list and conditional rendering it is time to write a stateful component (class) and a functional component (stateless) that receive props. Your challenge is to create a component that displays a list of online courses. If there are courses in the list will show them as in the image 1 otherwise display a message "OBS! No online courses found" as in image 2.
HINT: the functional component is responsible to display the list of online courses.
