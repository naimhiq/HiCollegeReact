## CHALLENGE9

Now you have learnt about useReducer() hook which helps you to manage complex state logic. In this challenge, there is a simple book list app where it contains a form that shall allow the user to add a book by entering its title and the author name. The app also shall allow the user to delete each book from the list.

Your task is to use useReducer to create the "add book" and "delete book" functions and write the logic to make the app work.

Find challenge under src map as below:

```bash
src -> components -> Challenges -> challenge9 -> Challenge9.js
```

HINT: Create reducer to group the action logics, use dispatch to access each action and payload values.
