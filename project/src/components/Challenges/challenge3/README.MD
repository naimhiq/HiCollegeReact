## CHALLENGE3

Now that you have learnt about forms and events let's build a stateful component (class) by combining the concepts covered so far. In this challenge the component includes initializing state, writing methods that set state, and assigning click handlers to trigger these methods.

The component keeps track of a count value in state. There are two buttons which call methods increment() and decrement(). Write these methods so the count value is incremented or decremented by 1 when the appropriate button is clicked. If the state count has the value 0 then decrement button should be disabled otherwise it is enabled. Also, create a reset() method so when the reset button is clicked, the count state is set to 0.
