## CHALLENGE3

Now that you have learnt about forms and events let's build a functional component by combining the concepts covered so far. In this challenge the component includes initializing state, defining update function with useState, and assigning click handlers to trigger the update function.

The component keeps track of a count value in state. There are two buttons which call increment() and decrement() functions. Write these functions so the count value is incremented or decremented by 1 when the appropriate button is clicked. If the state count has the value 0 then decrement button should be disabled, otherwise it is enabled. Also, create a reset() function, so when the reset button is clicked, the count state is set to 0.
