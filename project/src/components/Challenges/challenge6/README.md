## CHALLENGE6

Now that you have learnt about useRef and how we can trigger focus on an element. Let's create an app with an input and two buttons. When clicking on one of the buttons, it will make the input focused, and while clicking on the other button it will blur the input. Please implement useRef to achieve the task.

This challenge you find under src map as below:

```bash
src -> components -> Challenges -> challenge6 -> Challenge6.js
```
