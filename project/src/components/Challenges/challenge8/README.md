## CHALLENGE8

Now you have learned useCallback to avoid unnecessary component renderings. In this challenge there is a simple app where it contains a theme toggle button, and a getNumberList function (simulates api calls), which returns an array with values populated from a state value. This function is passed as props into List component.

Right now in the console (developer tool), you see a console log message gets triggered every time you click on the theme toggle button or when you change a value in the input.

Your challenge is to avoid this console.log gets triggered when the theme toggle button is clicked.

This challenge you find under src map as below:

```bash
src -> components -> Challenges -> challenge8 -> Challenge8.js
```
